We'll manage rainfall records as a vector of tuples or a struct containing city names, dates, and rainfall amounts. Since vectors don't inherently organize data by keys like maps, we'll have to iterate through the entire vector to calculate averages, which is less efficient but meets the requirement.

### Step 1: Define the `Date` and `RainfallRecord` Classes

First, let's redefine the `Date` class and introduce a `RainfallRecord` struct to hold each record.

```cpp
class Date {
public:
   int year, month, day;

   Date(int y, int m, int d) : year(y), month(m), day(d) {}

   // Function to display date in YYYY-MM-DD format (for debugging)
   void display() const {
       printf("%04d-%02d-%02d", year, month, day);
   }

   bool operator==(const Date& other) const {
       return year == other.year && month == other.month && day == other.day;
   }
};

struct RainfallRecord {
   std::string city;
   Date date;
   double rainfall;

   RainfallRecord(std::string c, Date d, double r) : city(std::move(c)), date(d), rainfall(r) {}
};
```

### Step 2: Redefine the `Rainfall` Class to Use Vectors

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

class Rainfall {
   std::vector<RainfallRecord> records;

public:
   // Adds rainfall data
   void addRainfall(const std::string& city, const Date& date, double rainfall) {
       records.emplace_back(city, date, rainfall);
   }

   // Calculates average rainfall for a city
   double calculateAverage(const std::string& city) {
       double totalRainfall = 0.0;
       int count = 0;

       for (const auto& record : records) {
           if (record.city == city) {
               totalRainfall += record.rainfall;
               ++count;
           }
       }

       return count > 0 ? totalRainfall / count : 0.0;
   }
};
```

### Step 3: Test Program

The test program will be similar to the previous version but adapted to the new structure.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main() {
   Rainfall rainfallData;

   // Simulated input data
   std::string inputData = "New York,2023-01-01,5.2\n"
                           "Los Angeles,2023-01-01,7.4\n"
                           "New York,2023-01-02,6.1\n"
                           "Los Angeles,2023-01-02,4.3\n";
   std::istringstream iss(inputData);
   std::string city, dateStr, line;
   double rainfall;
   int y, m, d;

   // Read input data
   while (std::getline(iss, line)) {
       std::istringstream lineStream(line);
       std::getline(lineStream, city, ',');
       std::getline(lineStream, dateStr, ',');
       sscanf(dateStr.c_str(), "%d-%d-%d", &y, &m, &d);
       Date date(y, m, d);
       lineStream >> rainfall;

       rainfallData.addRainfall(city, date, rainfall);
   }

   // Calculate and print average rainfall for each city
   std::cout << "Average Rainfall for New York: " << rainfallData.calculateAverage("New York") << std::endl;
   std::cout << "Average Rainfall for Los Angeles: " << rainfallData.calculateAverage("Los Angeles") << std::endl;

   return 0;
}
```

### Notes:
- This implementation is less efficient than using maps because it requires iterating through the entire vector to find records for a specific city. This might not be noticeable for small datasets but can become significant with larger ones.
- The `Date` class now includes a simple equality comparison operator, which is necessary for comparing dates if needed in more complex operations.
- This approach is more straightforward in terms of understanding how data is stored and iterated over, making it suitable for educational purposes or when working with small datasets.
